# First Time Setup Reference

## Backend Setup

Make sure that you have pip and python3 installed. At this point, you can choose to use either Pipenv or Virtualenv to manage your local dependencies.

### Pipenv

First, to [install pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv), run:

* `pip install --user pipenv`

Then, once this is complete, cd to `KeyAttendance/app/backend/` and run:

* `pipenv install`

This will load the dependencies of the project from our pipenv files.

### Virtualenv

First, to [install virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), run:

* `pip install --user virtualenv`

Then, once this is complete, cd to `KeyAttendance/app/backend/` and run:

* `virtualenv env`
* `"env/Scripts/activate"` if you're using Windows, or `source env/bin/activate` if you're using a Unix-based OS
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will create a virtual environment for you in the project folder and install the python dependencies.

## Frontend Setup

Make sure you have node / npm installed. You'll want to make sure that npm is added to your system path.

* `cd KeyAttendance/app/frontend`
* `npm install`

## Database Setup

First, you'll want to [download postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). When creating your database, set up a user where the username and password are both `postgres`. This is what Django currently expects the credentials to be. Additionally, you may want to add postgres to your system path for ease of access in the terminal.

Now, open up the postgres CLI, and run:

* `CREATE DATABASE keydb`

Close postgres. Now, change directories to make sure you're in `KeyAttendance/app/backend`, and run: 

* `manage.py migrate`
* `manage.py createsuperuser`

This will create the necessary tables in your postgres database and create a new admin account to access our website. Now, open the postgres CLI again, and run:

* `INSERT INTO auth_group VALUES (1, 'Admin');`
* `INSERT INTO auth_group_permissions(group_id, permission_id) select 1, id from auth_permission;`
* `INSERT INTO auth_user_groups(user_id, group_id) VALUES (1, 1);`

This will create the 'Admin' role on the website, which has access to all endpoints and views, and assigns it to your new superuser.

## All together now!

To see if everything is working properly, open two terminal windows. In the first:

* cd to `KeyAttendance/app/frontend/`
* `npm start`

Then, in the second, activate the virtual environment of your choice and run:

* `python manage.py runserver` if you're on a Windows machine, or `python3 manage.py runserver` if you're on a Unix machine.

If everything was installed correctly, this should open a browser pointed at `localhost:3000` with the website in it, and the username and password for the superuser you created in the database should grant access to the local site.
