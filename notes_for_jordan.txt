For jordan:

i'm currently writing the retrievebyHourAttendanceData function located in app/backend/views/reports.py (view for Reports model)

Pulling all records between a date range (abt a weeks worth) from dailyattendance table, I'd like this output returned from the function:



list of objs in this format:
{"date": yyyy-mm-dd, "time": ##:00:00, "num_visits": #}

one aggregate obj per date - rounded hour (rounded down) combination.


Basically I want django to count how many records there are per unique date - rounded hour combination.

(above requires date and time combined into one field though)
